# Website
This is a small little website, supposed to act as a kind of portfolio for some of my work (= 
It will display some basic web knowledge like html and css and ofcourse I'd like to get to know js a little more

Projects will vary very widely, from microcontrollers like the Raspberry over to self built bluetooth speakers over to the creation of some 3D Stuff with OpenGL

Also I'd like to adress some personal topics that are not related to technic whatsoever like Lego, Darts, Sports and many more

This will start very simple and I hope to expand on it over the next time (=
